## Just code

These add-ons are not being built intentionally as they are for testing purposes only. You'll need to download and place them under `/addons` folder of your Hass.io instance. 

## [AppDaemon](https://github.com/vkorn/hassio-addons/tree/master/appdaemon)

Beta-version of AppDaemon with HaDashboard v2.

## Usefull commands

If you're getting too much stalled containers, run (warning, can damage you setup!!!)

```
docker rm -v $(docker ps --filter status=exited -q 2>/dev/null)
docker rm -v $(docker ps --filter status=created -q 2>/dev/null)
```
Similar can be done for images.
